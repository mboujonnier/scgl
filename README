How to change edge's cost type
------------------------------
make MFLAGS='-Dcost_type="{type}"'

eg.
make MFLAGS='-Dcost_type="long double"'
make MFLAGS='-Dcost_type="short"'

It's recommended that cost type was scalar type.
Makefile will choose printf format by itself for:
 - short
 - unsigned short
 - int
 - unsigned int
 - long
 - unsigned long
 - long long
 - unsigned long long
 - float
 - double
 - long double

If your cost type isn't on list, you can change printf format by:
make MFLAGS='-Dcost_type="{type}" -Dcost_fmt=\"{printf format}\"'
