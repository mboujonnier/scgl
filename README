How to change edge's cost type
------------------------------
make COST_TYPE={TYPE}

eg.
make COST_TYPE=s
make COST_TYPE=ull

It's recommended that cost type was scalar type.
Makefile will choose printf format and MAX value by itself for types (COST_TYPE):
 - short (s)
 - unsigned short (us)
 - int (i) 
 - unsigned int (ui)
 - long (l)
 - unsigned long (ul)
 - long long (ll)
 - unsigned long long (ull)
 - float (f)
 - double (d)
 - long double (ld)

If your cost type isn't on list, you can change printf format and MAX value by:
make MFLAGS='-Dcost_type="{TYPE}" -Dcost_fmt=\"{FORMAT}\" -Dcost_max={VALUE}'
